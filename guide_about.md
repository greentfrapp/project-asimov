# About

Hi there! I'm Lim Swee Kiat, a graduate student enrolled in the [MSc. Urban Science, Policy and Planning](https://urbanscience.sutd.edu.sg/) course at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/).

**Machines Gone Wrong** is part of my final project, supervised by [Prof. Lim Sun Sun](https://www.sunsunlim.com/).

This guide is meant to introduce AI practitioners to the concerns of AI ethics, specifically algorithmic bias. As an undergraduate engineer and subsequent AI researcher, I found the social and ethical aspects lacking in the curriculum. This is my response to the problem and served as a way to document my learning journey about the topic. 

I will soon be headed to Stanford University for the MSCS program in fall 2019. For any queries or collaborations, drop me a mail at sweekiat [at] stanford [dot] edu!
