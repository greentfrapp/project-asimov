# Outline

**The questions at the end of the homepage should all link to a particular section in the guide.**

## Intro

- Sets the stage for AI ethics and specifically algorithmic bias.
- Sets the tone with language and images.
- Creates a hook for readers.
- Defines clear objectives.

## AI Ethics

- *When is AI not the answer?* (One of the most important questions)
- What makes AI different from other technologies?
- The Responsibility of the Engineer (Great power great responsibility comic?)

### Secondary

- Review of ethical guidelines 

## Fairness

- *What are the different ways to define fairness?*
- Definitions of fairness
	- Technical
	- Social (these should ideally be integrated)
- *How do we decide which definition to follow?*
- *How do we control the trade-off between bias and performance?* (see demo)
- *What should our client and users know?*

## Bias

*Probably have to split into more subsections*

- Types of Bias
	- By Source
		- Dataset
			- *How do we know if our dataset is biased?*
			- *How do we minimize bias in our dataset?*
		- Algorithm
			- *How do we detect and reduce bias in the training process?*
			- *How do we control the trade-off between bias and performance?*
		- Deployment
			- *What should our client and users know?*
			- *How do we consistently evaluate our models for bias?*
	- By Impact

## Datasets

- *What are some open-source datasets that are diverse?*
- Gendered Spaces
- Inclusive Images
- Dollar Street

## Tools

- *How do we detect and reduce bias in the training process?*
- *How do we consistently evaluate our models for bias?*
