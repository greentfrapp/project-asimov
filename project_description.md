# Research Project Description

*Lim Swee Kiat*

Singapore's Personal Data Protection Commission published a Model Artificial Intelligence (AI) Governance Framework (2019) earlier this year. The document actually raises some important points but I found it characteristically dull and lacking real-world examples that would have made for a more captivating and informative read. In contrast, there is the AI Playbook (2018) by investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, written in a more layperson fashion and replete with examples and links to other sources. However, the Playbook is primarily meant for business owners and focuses on the utility of AI and its relevance to products and services. I think there is room (and a need) for a clear and relatable guide to AI, in the context of governance and ethics. Something that combines the tone of the Playbook with the purpose of the Governance Framework.

After discussions with my advisor, Prof. Lim Sun Sun, we have chosen to work on an AI ethics guide for programmers and AI practitioners, taking advantage of my experience as an AI engineer. If time permits, this will be followed up with a guide targeting the general public, to raise awareness about AI technologies and related ethical issues. The guides will incorporate real-world examples and interactive elements, not unlike Andreessen Horowitz's AI Playbook. I am planning for the project to involve two main methods. First, analyzing multiple case studies of the following: 1) examples where AI has been ethically problematic, 2) attempted solutions for these problems, and 3) formal policies (international, national, commercial) related to AI ethics. This is meant to collate the pertinent issues, lessons learnt and best practices. Second, conducting interviews with relevant testers on drafts of the guides. This is meant to iterate on the drafts and ensure that the guides are helpful to their target audiences.
