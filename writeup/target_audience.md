## Target Audience

<!-- AI Practitioners - WHO and WHY? Refer back to pedagogical and what makes AI different -->

In the previous sections, we highlighted the importance of AI ethics and discussed current threads connecting ethics and technology. Throughout our discussion, an important group of actors has repeatedly cropped up. We are referring to the AI practitioners - the researchers, engineers and hobbyists - who are intimately involved in the design and deployment of AI systems.

### Why AI Practitioners?

The practitioners are often directly responsible for the design and deployment of the systems. The respective practitioners are likely the most familiar with the inner workings of a particular AI system. This means that the practitioners have a direct influence on the systems that they create. Take the example of Ren√© Carmille, who has sometimes been called the "first ethical hacker". Upon knowing that his machines were being used for the Nazi census of France, Carmille began a deliberate and systematic sabotage of his own machines. Similarly, in today's context, engineers and designers have the knowledge to make or break the systems that they create. AI practitioners need to be aware of the tremendous power and responsibility that they possess, as potential enablers or disablers of powerful AI systems.

Furthermore, we previously discussed the issue of ethics education in technical science curriculums. As we have seen before, the usefulness of ethics education remains doubtful to some educators. Moreover, for AI hobbyists who acquire their skills by self-study and exposure to online materials, tutorials and courses, there is no mandatory engineering ethics module. Instead, it is up to hobbyists to deliberately educate themselves about AI ethics. As such, there is room for a freely available online guide to AI ethics that is relatable to informally-trained practitioners.

Finally, with AI ethics receiving increasing attention, there has been a growing body of academic publications related to the field. While it is good that we are paying more attention to AI ethics, it can be challenging for a newcomer to sift out relevant publications and come to terms with the terminologies used. This implies a need for a primer that integrates different sources and communicates concepts in a relatable manner for these newcomers.

In conclusion, the primer in this project is targeted at AI practitioners and assumes some understanding of AI technologies. This mainly includes researchers and engineers. But it may also be useful for anyone helping to implement or recommend AI solutions. The primer intends to be an introductory text for the newcomer to AI ethics. It aims to communicate essential concepts in a relatable manner and consolidate useful publications and case studies. Finally, the primer also serves to direct readers to more detailed and comprehensive resources.
