This article reports the United States' Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) response towards AI-based devices that "learn and evolve", which are currently mainly medical in nature. These *learning* devices are contrasted against *locked-in* devices, which do not learn and have fixed weights, to use the technical term.

> In early April the agency released a white paper outlining a total product lifecycle approach that will focus on processes, quality control, testing and the organizational culture of the maker of such medical devices rather than the typical static assessment of a piece of equipment. The agency is seeking comments and feedback on the proposals.

The FDA's approach seems to be focused on the company rather than the specific equipment. While this might appear to make sense given the difficulty of constantly evaluating learning devices, I find it to be rather vague and seems prone to corruption and oversight. The quality assurance of AI-based devices that evolve is an important problem and an apparently novel one due to the nature of the technology. The problem is more than just the everchanging nature of the device. Consider a near future where devices grow and learn a customized profile of their clients. How can an authority evaluate such devices? Another issue is the problematic and unprovable robustness of AI algorithms. Finally, exacerbating the issue is the rapid pace of technology development that far outpaces legislative change.

> The FDA already has in place a precertification pilot program that began in 2017 for makers of software that function as medical devices. Software makers who are approved under this process could potentially launch new products without the FDAâ€™s premarket review or win approval with a few simple steps.

To counter the rapid pace of technology development, the FDA previously had the precertification pilot program that fast-tracked companies that were on a pre-defined list. However, this fast-tracking is understandably controversial, again due to the vagueness of the criteria, which makes it dependent on the person administering the decision and hence prone to corruption and oversight.
