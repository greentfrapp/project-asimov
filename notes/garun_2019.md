> During a particularly crowded Monday lunch rush, Bee Thanaraksalakul similarly didn't have the free time to notice who — or rather, what — was calling. **Thanaraksalakul, a waitress who works at my parents' Thai restaurant in Queens, New York, hadn't seen that the caller ID said Google Assistant on it when she picked up, and she doesn't remember if the caller said she was being recorded.** She did note, however, that she never would have guessed that she was speaking to an AI if I hadn't told her about Duplex. That's how realistic the voice sounded to her. "It even stuttered a little," she says.

In 2018 Google demonstrated Duplex during its IO conference, to great delight and horror. A public backlash led to Google quickly assuring that phonecalls will be prefaced with a message that the caller is an AI and the call will be recorded. However, as we read above, such messages often go unheard, just like the Terms and Conditions that we so often agree to. 

> When Duplex was first announced, one of my initial concerns was that the technology would further widen the gap between the privileged and the poor and weaken communication and empathy one party could have toward the other. Over the past few years, I’ve watched how apps like Seamless and Uber have seemingly entitled their users, encouraging them to appease their most demanding selves while seldom having to face or speak to the people fulfilling their needs. They’ve resulted in ads that highlight obnoxious requests from real food delivery orders that people hailed as “hilarious” and “clever.” And the infamous video of then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick belittling a driver on his platform for asking why UberBlack prices had dropped.

The author (Natt Garun) also wrote a previous article on Duplex in 2018 (see above), where he foresaw that a problem was the gap between the rich and the poor. In particular, he perceived Duplex as a potential cause of poor communication between the two, since the rich becomes even more distanced from the poor. Garun also cites the ridiculous requests made by food delivery users as a sign of this detachment and dehumanization.

> One year later, Duplex is still limited and, at least for now, has minimal impact on service workers aside from occasionally freaking them out, but there is perhaps an unintended byproduct of AI replacing humans: politeness.

> “It’s easier talking to [Duplex],” Thanaraksalakul says. English is her second language and working at the restaurant is where she gets to truly practice it. So when she repeats questions or misunderstands someone on the phone, the customer is not always patient with her. That misunderstanding can sometimes lead to an unpleasant experience when the customer shows up in person, or it can even result in a poor review online that talking to the AI can be an accidental reprieve.

> Kindness is not always an expected interaction at work in the service industry, and it’s one thing Myriah also appreciates about the call from Google. “It was kind of creepy,” she says, “but it was very polite.”
