This piece by Google CEO Sundar Pichai is quite ironic, given that Google has been at the heart of many privacy debacles. But Pichai raises a few good points about the nature of privacy and data collection.

> People today are rightly concerned about how their information is used and shared, yet they all define privacy in their own ways. I’ve seen this firsthand as I talk to people in different parts of the world. To the families using the internet through a shared device, privacy might mean privacy from one another. To the small-business owner who wants to start accepting credit card payments, privacy means keeping customer data secure. To the teenager sharing selfies, privacy could mean the ability to delete that data in the future. 

> Our mission compels us to take the same approach to privacy. For us, that means privacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services. Privacy must be equally available to everyone in the world.

Pichai raises three points for how data is useful for the consumer:

1. Services are more customized and more useful to the individual, such as Google Maps navigating you home
2. Aggregated data makes services better for everyone - route planning in Google Maps, queries in Google Translate and auto-complete in Gmail
3. Data helps serve ads, which helps keep most of Google's services, and content on the Internet, free

Pichai also cites two notable examples of how Google preserves privacy for its users: [federated learning](https://federated.withgoogle.com/) and easy access for consumers to view and change privacy settings and for users to delete and export personal data. Specifically, the latter is an important non-technical feature that can be implemented by other companies and enforced by the government.
