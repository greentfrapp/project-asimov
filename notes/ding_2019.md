Just wanted to highlight a note that Jeffrey Ding mentioned:

> I do want to address one point of substance: why am I harping on the technical content of these papers? I think it links to bigger issue with AI+politics/tech+politics research â€” or what I call the "technology abstraction problem." An exercise to illustrate this: take a sample of AI+politics articles/papers that claim AI has revolutionized X, and replace AI with "high-level statistics." **The best policy research on AI should use the word artificial intelligence in an abstract sense as few times as possible.** AI has become too prone to hype and it's too broad of a concept to be analytically coherent or useful, encompassing anything from subfields of fuzzy mathematics to research on decentralized drone warfare. Analysts should rigorously force themselves to specify what claims they are making about "AI" in terms of the domain and technological layer they are talking about.
