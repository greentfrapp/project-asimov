# Google's Duplex Uses A.I. to Mimic Humans (Sometimes)

The best part of this New York Times article is that it has two recordings of Duplex reservations - one by a human operator and one by the Duplex AI.

> In other words, Duplex, which Google first showed off last year as a technological marvel using A.I., is still largely operated by humans. While A.I. services like Google's are meant to help us, their part-machine, part-human approach could contribute to a mounting problem: the struggle to decipher the real from the fake, from bogus reviews and online disinformation to bots posing as people.

I am still not sure what are the ethical or societal implications of technologies like Google Duplex, if we examine them in isolation. In the bigger picture, yes, the technology poses dangers in the form of fake news and disinformation. But why exactly is there a need for Duplex to identify itself as an AI during the phone call (more precisely, the AI says, "I'm Google's automated booking service")? Is it an irrational fear or is there a real problem?
