## Sources of Bias

In the next few sections, we will look at a non-exhaustive list of possible sources of bias. These will be grouped by different stages of the AIS lifecycle. Examining these sources of bias can help with deciding whether an AIS solution is a good idea. Having decided to implement an AIS, understanding the different sources can also help to mitigate their effects.

In the following sections, we will look at sources of bias when:

- Preparing the data
- Training the model
- Deploying the solution

We will make extensive references to the works of Barocas & Selbst <dt-cite cite="barocas2016big"></dt-cite>, Selbst et al. <dt-cite cite="selbst2019fairness"></dt-cite> and Suresh & Guttag <dt-cite cite="suresh2019framework"></dt-cite>. We strongly advise readers to take a close look at these works for more details.
