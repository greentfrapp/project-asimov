# We Need to Build Up ‘Digital Trust’ in Tech

This article discusses the concept of *digital trust*. It is interesting to note how *trust* has cropped up in discussions of AI - consider the European Commission's guidelines to *Trustworthy* AI. In contrast, trust in the tool or technology appears to be rarely discussed for previous technologies such as automobiles, mechanical flight or guns. I feel that this might have something to do with the anthropomorphization of artificial

The authors break down *digital trust* into "two main components: mechanical trust and relational trust".

Mechanical trust refers to robustness and predictability of the technology. The authors cite the example of brakes in cars and how stepping on them means that the car unambiguously stops.

> Predictable, reliable outputs are expected to be delivered every time. If a system is secure and performs predictably, individuals will be more willing to use it. They’ll be able to trust it.

Relational trust refers to the belief in social artefacts such as formal laws and unspoken rules. The authors cite the example of the shared agreement to stop at red lights.

> Similarly, we need a shared agreement on when, where, why, and how technologies are used.

The authors then link these concepts back to the topic of AI technologies.

> While laudably attempting to include some components of relational trust in decisions about technology use, the process of creating these [AI ethics] panels lacks transparency, accountability, and auditability. So, despite being aimed at ethical use and building trust, these panels succumb to the distrusted mechanisms that made them seem necessary in the first place.

While I have my doubts about using the term "trust" in the context of AI, I like how the authors clearly breakdown digital trust into the two respective components. The argument makes sense and provides insight into recent problems and possible solutions. Note to self - use this as a reference for the deliverable.
