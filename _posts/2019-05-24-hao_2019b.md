# Making face recognition less biased doesnâ€™t make it less scary

[Link to article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612846/making-face-recognition-less-biased-doesnt-make-it-less-scary/)

This is a nice article that reviews three papers on commercial facial recognition systems.

The first [paper](http://www.aies-conference.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AIES-19_paper_223.pdf) compares the performance of commercial facial recognition systems across different demographics (gender and skin color). The paper uses Joy Buolamwini's Gender Shades dataset ([website](http://gendershades.org/); [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html)). The second [paper](http://www.aies-conference.com/wp-content/papers/main/AIES-19_paper_220.pdf) is by MIT CSAIL and demonstrates a new algorithm that mitigates bias even when trained on biased data. The third [paper](https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/trusted-ai/diversity-in-faces/documents/Diversity-in-Faces-Publication.pdf) is a very interesting one from IBM Research, which "identifies dozens of features for measuring diversity beyond skin color and gender". The idea is that these dozens of features also have to be "de-biased". Imagine if we find out that facial recognition systems perform poorly on longer faces as compared to shorter faces.

The other nice thing about the article is that it implies a dissociation between *algorithmic bias* and *algorithmic justice* (privacy and civil rights), in the context of facial recognition. Essentially, even if these algorithms are perfectly unbiased, does that warrant their widespread deployment in public spaces?

> "Without algorithmic justice, algorithmic accuracy/technical fairness can create AI tools that are weaponized," says Buolamwini.

Not sure if *algorithmic justice* is the best way to phrase it but the dissociation is an important point to highlight.
