This article is about Prof. Dawn Song's work with Oasis Labs (she is well-known for her work on adversarial attacks). The article mentions the use of a smart contract (like the Ethereum blockchain) in order to preserve the privacy of the original data owners.

With data collection being important for training AI models, the problem of preserving privacy while collecting data has received quite a lot of attention from researchers.

A related technology is that of federated learning (see links above), designed by Google researchers in 2017. Federated learning has been hyped up by Google in recent months, with trials beginning in hospitals. However, I am still unsure about how federated learning prevents linkage attacks and membership inference attacks. Will have to read further on this.
