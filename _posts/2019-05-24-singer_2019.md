# Amazon Faces Investor Pressure Over Facial Recognition

[Link to article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/technology/amazon-facial-recognition.html)

This is a more detailed look at the lead-up to Amazon's shareholder vote over two proposals ([aftermath](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48339142)).

> Amazon is becoming a national magnet for mounting opposition to facial surveillance â€” a technology that may be used to identify and track people at a distance without their knowledge or consent.

> Other companies have long sold facial surveillance to law enforcement agencies, but Amazon has differentiated itself by, in part, playing down warnings about the technology.

> Last year, [Google said that it would refrain](https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/ai-social-good-asia-pacific/) from offering facial recognition for general purposes until it had worked through the policy implications. This year, Bradford L. Smith, the president of Microsoft, said that his company had decided not to sell the surveillance technology to a police department seeking to freely use it on the general public.

> In its analysis, Institutional Shareholder Services wrote that Amazon "may be lagging its peers" because it has "not developed rules for bidding on government contracts, has not formed an artificial intelligence ethics committee and has not announced partnerships with civil liberties organizations."
