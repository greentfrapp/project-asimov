> Consumer Reports finds uneven access to the setting nearly 18 months after it was announced

This might be cited as an example of the lack of will in enforcing privacy. On the other hand, it may also be cited as an example of the difficulty in ensuring that software updates are rolled out to all users.

> No federal laws specifically govern the use of facial recognition or other biometric data such as fingerprints and retinal scans, but a handful of states and municipalities have passed regulations. San Francisco recently approved a city-wide ordinance restricting the use of facial recognition technology by government agencies such as the police. And a lawsuit by consumers alleges that Facebook’s facial recognition practices violate Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act.

On a side note, can you imagine if these settings turn out to be a placebo? How can the external public trust that these settings actually do what they say?
