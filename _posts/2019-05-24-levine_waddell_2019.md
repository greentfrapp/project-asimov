# The AI sharecroppers

[Link to article](https://www.axios.com/the-ai-sharecroppers-b316d333-ce00-47a1-afd5-219d6138461e.html)

This article highlights a new source of inequality - between the low-wage workers labeling data (often in developing countries) and the billion-dollar companies making money from the models trained on the labeled data.

The article goes on to cite a quote that describes this phenomenon as "one big arbitrage".

The article mentions a new book that touches on this - Ghost Work by Microsoft's Research's Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri.

But on the other hand, the new industry created around labelling is also a source of employment, especially important considering concerns about AI displacing jobs. The new jobs in the labelling industry is also far less dangerous and physically intensive compared to other low-wage low-skilled jobs. However, this also subjects such jobs to further competition, driving down wages.

Note to self - look for more substantial articles on this issue.
