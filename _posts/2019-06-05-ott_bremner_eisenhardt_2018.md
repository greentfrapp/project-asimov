# Beyond the Chicken and Egg

> Ott, T. E., Bremner, R. P., & Eisenhardt, K. M. (2018). Beyond the Chicken and Egg: Strategy Formation in Two-sided Marketplace Ventures.

This paper serves as an example of the inductive multiple case study method.

#### Justifying the Method

The authors spend a substantial amount of time focusing on the need for the research and the use of the inductive multiple case study method, across pages 2 to 8. They begin with addressing why the study of two-sided marketplaces is important, followed by a rather detailed look at two main existing approaches to the topic. The authors then describe the missing pieces in these existing approaches and how this research helps to fill the gap.

The authors continue to justify several details of their approach, including the cases chosen and the ways that they gathered information on these cases.

> A key strength of our study is its combination of field and archival cases, combining depth and breadth, respectively. For the field cases, we selected early-stage ventures (i.e., Seed or Series A financing) which helps to ensure that the ventures had a promising opportunity, but still lacked a well-formed strategy. Second, we selected firms in several sectors to add to the generalizability of our theory. Each addresses a distinct sector (i.e., culinary experiences, home services, and parking). Third, we include relatively high-performing firms in order to observe a sufficiently long history of strategy formation (including reaching accelerated growth). Yet, they all had failures and mistakes, bringing useful contrast to our theory-building.

> Complementing the field cases, we studied five archival cases. We chose these ventures because they have rich publicly available data and participate in a variety of sectors, adding to the generalizability of our theory. They are Airbnb (home-sharing), OpenTable (dining), Udacity (education), Lyft (ride-sharing), and Etsy (crafts). Although these firms may be longer lived and more successful than many, a sufficient history was necessary to understand the temporal flow of the strategy formation process. This requirement outweighed any advantage of a random sample, especially for a process-focused, theory-building study. Yet, each exhibited errors such as failed actions and major mistakes that bring useful insights to our theory building study.
