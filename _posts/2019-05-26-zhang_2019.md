# China’s top AI scientist drives development of ethical guidelines

[Link to article](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2181573/chinas-top-ai-scientist-drives-development-ethical-guidelines)

This article is a much-needed one shining light on China's position on AI ethics.

The article describes the appointment of Chen Xiaoping, professor and director of the Robotics Laboratory at the University of Science and Technology of China, as the leading researcher to establish China's ethical committee for AI.

> The committee was looking into sectors such as data privacy, AI in medicine, self-driving vehicles, and – of particular urgency, Chen said – AI in senior care.

> Privacy is another area of high public concern in China, where AI and facial recognition technology are already deployed at subways, pedestrian crossings and some supermarkets. The technology has even helped police catch criminals on the run at concerts.

This comes at the heels of the global outcry over the world's first gene-edited twins by Chinese scientist He Jiankui.

I will be looking into AI ethics in China via Chinese new sources as well, to get a more comprehensive understanding of global sentiments about AI ethics.
