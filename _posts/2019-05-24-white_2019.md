# Trans-inclusive Design

[Link to article](https://alistapart.com/article/trans-inclusive-design/)

While the article primarily focuses on designing for trans-inclusivity, I find that the article is also a nice model for explaining ethical issues in a straightforward manner. Issues are presented conceptually, followed by examples and finally ending off with "Hereâ€™s what we can do".

The article is also a nice comprehensive source of examples for gender bias in technology. There are many examples here along with potential solutions that deserve a detailed read.
