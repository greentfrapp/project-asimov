This article takes a look at the extent of commercial involvement in recent legislative discussions and politicking around AI ethics.

I think parallels can be drawn to competition laws, smoking legislation and any form of legislation that has the potential to severely impede the interests of powerful commercial entities.

A possible distinction here could be the sophistication of AI technologies, which prevents accurate understanding or assessment by politicians, while many AI experts are in the pockets of the powerful commercial entities. This leads to a power imbalance based on the knowledge deficit. In that sense, a stronger role has to be played by non-commercial entities such as the AI Now Institute, as well as academic institutions.

More thought has to be put into thinking about what makes this special compared to previous parallels? And what can be learned or transfered from previous parallels?
