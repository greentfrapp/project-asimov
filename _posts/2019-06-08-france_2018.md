# France's AI for Humanity

([link](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/))

*The report is also known as the Villani Report and alternatively titled For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence — Towards a French and European Strategy. These notes focus on the following sections: **Introduction**, **Part 5 — What are the Ethics of AI?** and **Part 6 — For Inclusive and Diverse Artificial Intelligence**.*

## Defining AI

> Fundamentally, it refers to a programme whose ambitious objective is to understand and reproduce human cognition; creating cognitive processes comparable to those found in human beings.

Considers AI as a multi-disciplinary study.

> Therefore, we are naturally dealing with a wide scope here, both in terms of the technical procedures that can be employed and the various disciplines that can be called upon: mathematics, information technology, cognitive sciences, etc.

And acknowledges the significance of cultural works in shaping the perception and development of AI.

> Fantasies — often ethnocentric and based on underlying political ideologies — thus play a major role, albeit frequently disregarded, in the direction this discipline is evolving in.

Relates AI to the "datafication of the world".

> Thanks to complex algorithms, increased computing power and the exponential growth of human and machine-generated data [...] It is worth noting that progress in AI is taking place in a technological context marked by the datafication of the world [...]

The authors also touch on the political ramifications of AI (see page 5), which appears to be a major motivation for this report.

## A Meaningful AI

This report revolves around the concept of "a meaningful AI", which is defined across several paragraphs.

> A meaningful AI implies that we know the way forward.

> A meaningful AI is another way to say thatitis not an end in itself. Its development should take several considerations into account.

> A meaningful AI finally implies that AI should be explainable: explaining this technology to the public so as to demystify it—and the role of the media is vital from this point of view—but also explaining artificial intelligence by extending research into explicability itself.
