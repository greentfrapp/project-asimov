> Youtube is trying to get on top of its policies around hate content, as (like Facebook) it shifts from the previous default 'we shouldn't use our power to block any speech if it's legal" to something else, but isn't sure what that would mean, or what a consistent and repeatable test for deciding what to remove would look like, and scrambles to catch up.
