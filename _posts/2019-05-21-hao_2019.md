# Five questions you can use to cut through AI hype

[Link to article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613535/five-questions-you-can-use-to-cut-through-ai-hype/)

Karen Hao lists five main questions for "assessing the quality and validity of a companyâ€™s machine-learning product":

1. What is the problem it is trying to solve?
2. How is the company approaching that problem with machine learning?
3. How does the company source its training data?
4. Does the company have processes for auditing its products?
5. Should the company be using machine learning to solve this problem?

I find these questions overly simplistic for actually evaluating "quality and validity" but nevertheless, they are a good starting point and a nice TL;DR for non-AI-practitioners. I wonder if we can do something similar in simplicity but with more depth for AI ethics.
