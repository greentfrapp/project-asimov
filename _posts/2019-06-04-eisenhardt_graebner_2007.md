# Theory Building from Cases: Opportunities and Challenges

> Eisenhardt, K. M., & Graebner, M. E. (2007). Theory building from cases: Opportunities and challenges. *Academy of management journal*, *50*(1), 25-32.

This paper by Stanford professor Kathleen M. Eisenhardt elaborates on the inductive case study methodology, which she has had extensive experience in.

#### The importance of justifying the method

> But when using theory building from cases as a research strategy, researchers also must take the added step of justifying why the research question is better addressed by theory-building rather than theory-testing research. The implicit assumption is that theory building from cases is less precise, objective, and rigorous than large-scale hypothesis testing. Moreover, failure to convince readers that a theory-building study is warranted in the first few pages can sink a manuscript before readers ever reach the findings. In other words, readers may ask, *So why is this an inductive study?*

The authors describe the most effective answer as one that clarifies **why the research question is significant** and **why there is no existing theory**. Thereafter, since there is no existing theory, *theory-building* becomes essential.

In the case of this project, I might spend a few paragraphs describing how current literature on AI ethics and algorithmic bias is inadequate.

The authors go further to describe two types of research questions - theory-driven and phenomenon-driven.

I might frame the current project as an extension of ethics or technology management(theory-driven) or as an independent and recent phenomenon (phenomenon-driven).

#### Selection of Cases

> Another frequent challenge to theory building from cases concerns case selection. Some readers make the faulty assumption that the cases should be representative of some population, as are data in large-scale hypothesis testing research. In other words, they ask, *How can the theory generalize if the cases aren't representative?*

Here the authors introduce the term **theoretical sampling** as a contrast to random or stratified sampling.

> Theoretical sampling simply means that cases are selected because they are particularly suitable for illuminating and extending relationships and logic among constructs.

#### Single versus Multiple Cases

**Sampling for single cases**

> Theoretical sampling of single cases is straightforward. They are chosen because they are unusually revelatory, extreme exemplars, or opportunities for unusual research access

**Sampling for multiple cases**

> multiple cases are chosen for theoretical reasons such as replication, extension of theory, contrary replication, and elimination of alternative explanations

Simply put, when selecting multiple cases, each case serves a specific purpose. The authors cite an illustrative example.

> For example, Graebner and Eisenhardt (2004) studied acquisition from the seller per spective by examining three replicated cases in which the executives sold their companies, a contrary replication in which executives could have sold their companies but did not, and then further cases in different industries that explored industry level explanations

For this project, I might consider sampling from different applications (facial recognition, financial, employment) to uncover a general theory of algorithmic bias. In addition, I might also compare reports and guidelines from different nations or different entities (international, national, commercial, NGO), to identify differing priorities or circumstances.

Another possibility is a longitudinal study across different technologies.

#### Presenting Empirical Evidence

This section addresses the issue of presenting rich qualitative data in limited space. While less of a problem in single-case studies or multicase books, this is a significant issue in multicase journal articles.

The paper suggests several mechanisms, which were also demonstrated in a later paper by Eisenhardt (*Beyond the Chicken and Egg*).

This is an important consideration that I should pay attention to - the presentation of the case studies in support of my claims.

#### Writing the Theory

>  First, sketch the emergent theory in the introduction. Then, in the body of paper, write each proposition (implicitly or explicitly stated), and link it to the supporting empirical evidence for each construct and for the proposed relationship between the constructs. When the research is well done, the propositions will be consistent with most (or even all) of the cases because the researcher has effectively "pattern matched" between theory and data. It is also crucial to write the underlying theoretical arguments that provide the logical link between the constructs within a proposition. These arguments can be drawn from case evidence (e.g., an informant explaining the logic) and/or from more detached logic. Finally, provide a visual theory summary such as a "boxes and arrows" diagram or summary table. Eisenhardt (1989a), Gilbert (2005), and Maurer and Ibers (2006) offer exemplars of the multiple ways of writing theory within a single paper. Using these multiple ways to present the theory is often a safe starting point for initial manuscript submissions.

The authors also raise an interesting point on the relationship between complexity of theory and number of cases.

> Somewhat surprisingly, single cases can enable the creation of more complicated theories than multiple cases, because single-case researchers can fit their theory exactly to the many details of a particular case. In contrast, multiple-case researchers retain only the relationships that are replicated across most or all of the cases.
