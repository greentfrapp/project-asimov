# What Boards Need to Know About AI

[Link to article](https://hbr.org/2019/05/what-boards-need-to-know-about-ai)

Similar to Schwab's [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90252753/a-skeptics-guide-to-thinking-about-ai) on the 2018 AI Now symposium but in a commercial slant, this author lists 4 "guideposts that board members in any industry can use to orient themselves when they begin the [AI] journey".

1. **It’s math, not magic.** - Board members should be encouraged to understand the basics of AI and good use of AI should be a natural extension of what the company is already doing
2. **Well-run AI projects should be easily understood.** - In line with the above point, from the point of view of board members, stakeholders and decision-makers, AI projects should be "explainable in plain English" and describe "how real groups of people, whether employees, customers or management, will be affected"
3. **You don’t have to get creepy to get value out of data.** - This highlights an important point, which is that there is often no need for every sliver of sensitive data, in order to benefit from AI solutions
4. **AI is an operating expense, not a capital investment.** - This is another very important point, which is that AI solutions should be seen as a continuous monthly or yearly expense, rather than a one-time investment
