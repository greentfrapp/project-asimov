# Uber, Lyft drivers manipulate fares at Reagan National causing artificial price surges

This article demonstrates how humans can "game" an algorithm, in this case Uber and Lyft's algorithms for calculating price surges.

Goodhart's Law is commonly quoted as, "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." The law can be used to describe how AI algorithms often subvert expectations and optimize to unintended consequences. Of course, Goodhart's Law originally stems from human behavior and it is not surprising to find that humans can also game the system in similar ways.

Another related concept is that of nudging and this article shows an example of an AI implementation leading to an unintended nudge.
