This article is a specific example of a Brooklyn estate where tenants are actively fighting against facial recognition implemented by the landlord. In these cases of subsidized housing being subject to extra surveillance, we see again the pitting of rich vs poor and privileged vs unprivileged.

> The use of this technology in public and subsidized housing appears to be spreading: In Detroit, a [controversial surveillance program](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/project-green-light-faces-scrutiny-as-detroit-eyes-mandate-for-thousands-of-businesses/Content?oid=8539251) [that recently integrated facial recognition](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/10/30/detroit-police-facial-recognition-software/107166498/) may be coming [to public housing](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/11/06/project-green-light-detroit-public-housing/1712494002/). Since 2010, activists in Los Angeles have been fighting against the police department’s push to outfit [public housing projects with security cameras](https://www.scpr.org/news/2010/06/24/16494/lapd-dramatically-increase-use-surveillance-camera/), and use [facial recognition technology to match the captured faces](https://www.laweekly.com/news/forget-the-nsa-the-lapd-spies-on-millions-of-innocent-folks-4473467) to pictures in gang databases. (Those databases have been criticized [as being overly broad, inaccurate, and opaque](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/whats-wrong-californias-gang-databases-and-gang-injunctions).) Even private developers are jumping on the bandwagon. In New York, affordable housing developer Omni New York [boasted](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/omni-new-york-llc-celebrates-opening-of-176-units-of-leed-certified-affordable-housing-for-families-and-formerly-homeless-veterans-300409398.html) it would feature “a state of the art facial recognition system at the front entrance” of one of its Bronx developments for low-income families and former homeless veterans.

This would be useful as a specific example of facial recognition in a very social context.
