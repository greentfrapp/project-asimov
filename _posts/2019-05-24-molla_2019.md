# People say they care about privacy but they continue to buy devices that can spy on them

[Link to smart device survey by Consumers International and the Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CI_IS_Joint_Report-EN.pdf)

> Some 63 percent of people find connected devices to be “creepy,” and 75 percent don’t trust the way their data is shared by those devices, according to a survey of people in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, and the United Kingdom.

This article is a great one that focuses on the human aspect of privacy as opposed to the algorithmic and industrial aspects. Specifically, the article proposes some reasons, across its different sections, why people appear to irrationally give up their privacy.

- People don’t understand the extent of data smart devices are collecting
- The trade-offs are worth it
- Consumers don’t have other options
- People assume the government will take care of it
- We don’t actually care that much about privacy

Should look at this again when writing up the guides.
