# Facebook's A.I. Whiz Now Faces the Task of Cleaning It Up. Sometimes That Brings Him to Tears.

[Link to article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/technology/facebook-ai-schroepfer.html)

This profile of Facebook's CTO, Mike Schroepfer, elicits a lot of sympathy for his tremendous Sisyphean undertaking - the task of content moderation on Facebook.

Whether intentional or not, the article clearly highlights how power and responsibility is concentrated in the hands of a select few. This would be a good example to cite for discussions on power relations in AI ethics and regulations.

The article also showcases how AI can be inadequate in certain cases - in this case the detection of unsavoury content (unfortunately, this also says a lot about human ingenuity in generating such content).

On a side note, Schroepfer mentions how he had to rewatch the Christchurch livestream multiple times to understand how Facebook can successfully flag similar videos in the future.

> "I wish I could unsee it," he said.
