# Congress wants to protect you from biased algorithms, deepfakes, and other bad AI

[Link to article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613310/congress-wants-to-protect-you-from-biased-algorithms-deepfakes-and-other-bad-ai/)

This is a nice summary article of governmental action against AI abuse.

The following actions are cited:

- USA's Algorithmic Accountability Act ([link](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Algorithmic%20Accountability%20Act%20of%202019%20Bill%20Text.pdf))
- UK's Online Harms White Paper ([link](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/793360/Online_Harms_White_Paper.pdf))
- France's AI for Humanity ([link](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/))
- Australia's AI Ethics Framework ([link](https://consult.industry.gov.au/strategic-policy/artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework/))

The article also describes the US government's multi-pronged approach - coupling the Algorithmic Accountability Act with several other bills, such as the Deceptive Experiences To Online Users Reduction Act ([article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302199/big-tech-dark-patterns-senate-bill-detour-act-facebook-google-amazon-twitter))

Finally, the article also highlights an important problem - that most policymakers do not understand the problems at hand.

> In addition, currently only a handful of members of Congress have a deep enough technical grasp of data and machine learning to approach regulation in an appropriately nuanced manner. “These ideas and proposals are kind of niche right now,” Nkonde says. “You have these three or four members who understand them.”
