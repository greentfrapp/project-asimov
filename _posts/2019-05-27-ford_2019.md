# Why I (Still) Love Tech: In Defense of a Difficult Industry

[Link to article](https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-love-tech-defense-difficult-industry/)

This piece reads like part love letter to the tech industry and part confession about tech's broken promises.

> I wish I could take my fellow CEOs by the hand (they’re not into having their hands held) and show them Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and any of the other places where people are angry. Listen, I’d say, you’re safe. No one is coming for your lake house, even if they tweet “I’m coming for your lake house.” These random angry people are merely asking us to keep our promises. We told them 20-some years ago that we’d try to abolish government and bring a world of plenty. We told them we’d make them powerful, that we’d open gates of knowledge and opportunity. We said, “We take your privacy and security seriously at Facebook.” We said we were listening. So listen! They are submitting a specification for a world in which fairness is a true currency, and then they’re trying to hold everyone to the spec (which is, very often, the law). As someone who spent a lot of time validating XML and HTML pages, I empathize. If bitcoin can be real money, then fairness can be a real goal.

Perhaps I can end the guides on a similar note, a love letter to AI and a reflection on AI's broken promises.
