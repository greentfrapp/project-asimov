# Office worker launches UK's first police facial recognition legal action

[Link to article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/21/office-worker-launches-uks-first-police-facial-recognition-legal-action)

This is an extreme case of the fight for privacy - an office worker from Cardiff has launched a lawsuit, alleging that the South Wales police had illegally violated his privacy when his face was scanned in a public space.

In the words of his lawyer, "[Automated facial recognition (AFR)] has profound consequences for privacy and data protection rights, and the legal framework which currently applies to the use of AFR by the police does not ensure those rights are sufficiently protected."

> Liberty [the campaign group supporting the lawsuit] compares scans by facial recognition cameras to taking people’s DNA or fingerprints without their knowledge or consent. It says there is no legal framework governing the use of the technology and evidence shows it discriminates against women and people from a BAME background.

*BAME is a term used in the UK to refer to black, Asian and minority ethnic people.*

> Megan Goulding, a lawyer at Liberty, previously said: "Facial recognition technology snatches our biometric data without our knowledge or consent, making a mockery of our right to privacy … It belongs to a police state and has no place on our streets."

> South Wales Police argues its use of AFR does not infringe the privacy or data protection rights of Bridges as it is used in the same way as photographing a person’s activities in public, and it does not retain the data of those not on its "watch list".

I think this primarily stems from a subjective definition of privacy and differences in the perceived extents of the pros and cons of AFR. It would be useful in the guide to propose universal definitions for these concepts if possible.
