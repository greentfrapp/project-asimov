		<h2>Cats and Dogs</h2>
		<p>
			Suppose for a moment that there's a new disease going around infecting our beloved pets, called the Bloody Angry Disease (BAD). As per its name, it causes our pets to get really angry and aggressive. Turns out that it affects 40% of cats and 60% of dogs.

		<h2>AI to the Rescue</h2>
		<p>
			Imagine that a company develops an AI system to diagnose if a pet has gotten BAD, by tracking its temperature, weight and appetite. Pets diagnosed with BAD are then sent for treatment, which involves lots of cold baths boohoo.

			The company states that its system is fair to both cats and dogs, because when a pet is diagnosed as BAD, there is a 80% chance it is actually BAD, regardless of species.

		<p>
			Out of the pets diagnosed BAD, we do get about 80% of them being actually BAD.
