# Types of Algorithmic Bias

*Here we dive deep into the types of algorithmic bias, using two main lenses - classifying by source and by impact. Demos here!*

## By Source

- Defining the *Target Variable* and *Class Labels*
- Training Data (offline and online)
	- Labeling Examples
	- Data Collection
- Feature Selection
- Proxies
- Masking

## By Impact

- Allocation
- Representation
