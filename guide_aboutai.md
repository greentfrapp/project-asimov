# Importance of AI Ethics

*This section discusses what makes AI different from other technologies. Then we have an overview of AI ethics frameworks and a summary of key principles. Finally, we discuss the politics of algorithms.*

## How is AI different from other technologies?

### Illusion of Neutrality

There is often an assumption that AI systems make better decisions

### Speed and Scale

AI systems are often deployed for speed and scale. Google Translate serves over 500 million queries a day. Amazon's Rekognition claims to be able to perform "real-time face recognition across tens of millions of faces". This also means that technical and social flaws can spread extremely quickly.

### Democracy

AI research has largely been democratic. The vast majority of researchers share their work freely on arxiv.org and GitHub. Advances in hardware mean that consumer-grade computers are sufficient to execute many algorithms. Open-source software libraries and datasets are available to anyone with Internet access. The combination of accessible research, hardware, software and data means that many people have the ability to train and deploy their own AI systems.

We need to dispel the myth of the neutral AI. We need to fix widespread AI systems before they can do more harm. We need to reach out to all potential practitioners who can deploy these systems, from engineers to hobbyists.

	All three points above point to an urgent need for public education about AI ethics.

## What is AI ethics?

*Brief overview of AI frameworks and common principles. Show framework demo.*

## Do AI systems have politics?

*This section is strongly inspired by Langdon Winner's* Do Artifacts have Politics? *published in 1980.*

- Recognizing the politics of artifacts
- Recognizing the roles of AI engineers and researchers
- Recognizing the trade-offs and options available (e.g. not to develop)
- Recognizing that adoption of algorithms over humans also means adoption of a perspective that the algorithm is better than humans at the specific task (cumulation of efficiency, effectiveness etc.)
