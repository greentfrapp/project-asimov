## Introduction

Highlight the pressing need for relatable primers to artificial intelligence and its problems. Focus on short-term problems.

## Definitions

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

> “Artificial Intelligence (AI)” refers to a set of technologies that seek to simulate human traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception, learning and planning. AI technologies rely on AI algorithms to generate models. The most appropriate model(s) is/are selected and deployed in a production system.

> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions – with  some  degree  of autonomy – to achieve  specific  goals.AI-basedsystems  can  be  purely  software-based,  acting  in  the  virtual  world  (e.g.  voice  assistants,  image  analysis software,  search  engines,  speech  and  face  recognition  systems)  or  AI  can  be  embedded  in  hardware  devices  (e.g. advanced robots,  autonomous  cars,  drones or Internet of Things applications)

> An AI system is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or   decisions influencing real or virtual environments. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy.

## What's Up with AI?

Here we explore what makes AI different from other technologies.

- Illusion of omnipotence
- Correlation vs causation
- Speed and scale
- Complexity and opacity
- Trust? (see EU [guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai) on Trustworthy AI; Trustworthy cars?)

## Bias - A Pressing Problem

- The illusion of neutrality
- Hidden bias (correlations)
- Feedback loops
- When is bias not bias?
- No corrective samples
- Favoring / harming / works better / worse for certain demographics
- Only available to certain demographics
- Explainability vs transparency and what these concepts mean for bias

## Useful Tools

## Other Short-term Issues

- Privacy
	- Online and public spaces
	- The right to be forgotten
- Explainability
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Robustness
- Fabrication and misinformation

## Long-term Considerations

- Consciousness and rights
- Human-AI alignment
- Singularity

## tl;dr
